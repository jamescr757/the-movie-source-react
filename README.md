## Overview 
This app utilizes four endpoints of the TMDB (the movie database) api - Top Rated, Popular, Now Playing, and Upcoming movies. Each endpoint has its own page that displays the movies in a grid.

The user can click on the movie card to view details about the movie. Furthermore, inside the modal there's a button to watch trailers. The movie trailers are delivered by Google's YouTube API without ads.
